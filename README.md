# ðŸ“Š My Reading Analytics Dashboard

As a **Lead Data Analyst / Analytics Engineer**, I love turning raw data into stories. This project is a playground where I explore my own reading habits â€” the books I start, the books I finish, my reading speed, and daily reading patterns â€” using Python, Streamlit, and interactive visualizations.  

Think of it as a **portfolio piece** and a **mini data story**: some charts are polished, others are experiments that didnâ€™t fully work out. The goal is to showcase **technical skills**, **analytical thinking**, and **creative storytelling** with real, messy data.

## What Youâ€™ll See

- **Key Metrics at a Glance** â€“ Total reading sessions, average session duration, and more.  
- **Timeline of Reading** â€“ Start and finish dates for every book, color-coded by category.  
- **Daily Reading Sessions** â€“ Each session mapped by hour, visualizing time-of-day patterns.  
- **Reading Speed Analysis** â€“ Interactive scatter plot of reading speed vs. total time per book.  
- **Year-to-Year Comparison** â€“ How my reading evolves over time: books, authors, pages, and daily minutes.

## Why This Matters

Beyond just charts, this dashboard demonstrates how to **turn data into insight**. I tackle challenges like handling outliers, filtering data, creating interactive visuals, and blending static and dynamic charts â€” exactly the kind of problems a Lead Data Analyst or Analytics Engineer solves daily.  

Itâ€™s a **personal project** that highlights my ability to combine **technical expertise** with **data storytelling**, making insights accessible and engaging.
